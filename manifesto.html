            <p class="manifesto-letter">N</p>
            <p>Contrary to the standard perception of Hedonism, often deemed synonymous with vulgar debauchery, I endow Hedonism of this era with new, majestic qualities. Without them, it would merely be another ignorant whim of humanity.</p>

            <h3>Moderation</h3>
            <p>Living amidst an abundance of available pleasures, it's easy to get a sunstroke. Yet, by favouring rational Moderation, the doors to a deeper and more enriched perception of life old open up:</p>
            <p>Moderation is the ability to maintain a balance between the internal and external, the white and black, and any other dualities at the moment of decision-making.</p>

            <p class="manifesto-letter">II</p>
            <h3>Appropriateness</h3>
            <p>The absence of a single truth is as evident as the existence of a universal law governing the Universe. Different situations, sharing a common root, may require radically different actions from you.</p>
            <p>The purposeful allocation of resources — time, money health — that leads to a positive outcome aligned with intention is called Appropriateness. Choosing the perfectly fitting puzzle piece at the moment offers deep relaxation, against which fleeting joys fade. Repect for others is also appropriate, as causing discomfort to others with one's hedonism hardly allows one to enjoy life when faced with backlash.</p>
            <p>Appropriateness is the ability to make decisions by finding a balance between personal needs, resources, and the needs of those around.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="manifesto-chapter">
            <p class="manifesto-letter">III</p>
            <h3>Attention</h3>
            <p>Vivid, profound attention to the moment, to oneself, and to the surrounding world — to every detail woven into the fabric of our existence — is a true art. In the hedonistic understanding, Attention is not just an act of observation, but an active process in which we choose which aspect of our endlessly rich experience to embrace and enrich. Attention is the bridge between the external world of pleasures and the internal world of experiences. Only through Attention does pleasure transform from raw material into a refined dish for the soul.</p>
            <p>Attention is a call to action, an invitation to discover the world in all its diversity and richness, to cherish every moment, and to find in this process deep and lasting satisfaction.</p>

            <p class="manifesto-letter">IV</p>
            <h3>Choice</h3>
            <p>Thanks to Choice, Hedonism can become a chosen tool for evolution. In the kaleidoscope of life events, desires are often dictated by fear of experiencing emotions and feelings. Elegantly smoking a cigarette in a "Hedonistic" manner, a beauty simply avoids the pain caused by a father.</p>
            <p>This is not about pleasure. This is where questions of Choice arise. When stress — or "Hedonism" - offers solutions like sugar, nicotine, or the "black mirror," each decision aimed at obtaining higher quality dopamine becomes a brick on the yellow brick road of Personal Evolution.</p>
            <p>Choice is awareness in every moment.</p>

        <div class="manifesto-chapter">
            <p class="manifesto-letter">V</p>
            <h3>The Voice of Stillness</h3>
            <p>Before dawn or well pest midnight, when least expected, the Voice of Stillness can be heard from the darkness. It sounds like an answer to prayers, like the voice of a mother lulling a child to sleep. This voice belongs to the infinite soul that unites all and highlights a unique personal path. Immersing into Silence, a soft, gentle Voice can be heard, guiding where to go.</p>
            <p>The Voice of Stillness is the sound with which the universe began, for " In the beginning was the Word."</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="manifesto-chapter">
            <p class="manifesto-letter">VI</p>
            <h3>Gratitude</h3>
            <p>This principle highlights the importance of gratitude for present pleasures and joys in life. The practice of Gratitude can enhance the perception of positive moments and increase the sense of satisfaction from life.</p>
            <p>Gratitude is the ability to send spiritual texts to loved ones daily from the heart, expressing appreciation for all the good in life, including well-being.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="manifesto-chapter">
            <p class="manifesto-letter">VIII</p>
            <h3>Intention</h3>
            <p>A clear Intention gives energy to continue making quality Choices, to remain Moderate, to maintain Attention and contact with the Voice of Stillness, to evaluate the Appropriateness of our actions, and to spice up this glorious bouquet with Gratitude. Adhering to all these rules is a challenging task, necessitating the identification of a true goal towards which striving brings joy, and solidifying this aspiration in the form of an Intention. Thus, Hedonism becomes an ally on the path.</p>
            <p>Intention is an impulse framed in words, acting as an arrow on the coordinate system.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="manifesto-chapter">
            <p class="manifesto-letter">VIIII</p>
            <h3>Constancy</h3>
            <p>Hedonism, like any practice, requires Constancy, An endless number of attempts to satisfactorily meet needs will eventually teach how to choose the best possible Here and Now. Behind Constancy lies the door to a magical, wonderful world of knowledge about how to treat oneself, how to find resources, whom to interact with, what to eat often, what on special occasions, and what not to feed even to a dog.</p>
            <p>Constancy is the unwavering fidelity to one's beliefs and views. Persistence wears down resistance.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="manifesto-chapter">
            <p class="manifesto-letter">IX</p>
            <h3>Creation</h3>
            <p>In conclusion, Hedonism serves as a tool for returning to the Assemblage Point or maintaining it. From this point, true Creation begins, multiplying goodness in the world. Here, we encounter Labor, Diligence, Constancy — tools thanks to which Homo has evolved into Sapiens, or the crown of creation. (Although, perhaps, it's all about the protein).</p>
            <p>Conscious Hedonism teaches us to listen to the thin voice of the soul. Creation confirms the soul's intentions in the material world.</p>
